Today we are so busy with work in our lives that it sometimes gets overwhelming. 
Well, we introduce to you, SELENA, a futuristic voice assistant that can: 
	* Make to do lists for you. 
	* Search the internet to find answers to your queries.
	* Do your basic tasks on your PC or Laptop with just your voice.
	* Make general conversation. 
	* And so much more. 

We have used an open source python script and library to build this. 

The project contains:

* A Python source file with all the code. 
* A read me file to get you started quickly. 
* A Power Point Presentation to introduce you to AI powered voice assistant technologies. 

How to get started:

* Clone the repository from github to your local environment. 
* Open the source file named SELENA.py in VS Code.
* Run in VS Code and test SELENA out. 

We thank you for taking out valuable time to go through our project.
